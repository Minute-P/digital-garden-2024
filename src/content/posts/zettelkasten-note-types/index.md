TODO:

slip-box note

the main note type in the zettelkasten system

Which word I should use for this notes:

- just slip-box note?
- ~evergreen note
- atomic note
- permanent note

---

Note types by how long we store it, how we keep it? (p 41)

1. Fleeting note - temporary
2. Permanent note - keep it permanently - there are two types of note that we keep it forever
   1. slip-box note (in the slip-box)
   2. literature note (in reference system)
3. Project note - keep by project

---

Note types by the situation we take it?

1. Fleeting note - quickly capturing the information
2. Literature note - when reading, to understand something
3. Permanent note - process fleeting notes and literature notes we have taken (within 1-2 days)
